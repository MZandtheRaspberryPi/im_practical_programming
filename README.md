This is a landing page for a collection of scripts and projects, some practical and useful day to day, others with no redeeming usefulness other than fun! See below projects and links:

## all_seeing_drone  
A project to introduce autonomous movement and face-following for a robolink CoDrone. See the README [here](https://github.com/MZandtheRaspberryPi/all_seeing_drone).

## Buddy Robot Dance with ROS
This was a fun project to get a robot to dance using ROS. I used a robot from Slant Concepts and recoded it to work with ROS, via rosserial and a bluetooth connection. Check it out [here](https://github.com/MZandtheRaspberryPi/ros_buddy).

## Minecraft Server on your Pi
This has some links to guides to setup a minecraft server on your pi, as well as some tips on running the server and extra commands! Check it out [here](https://github.com/MZandtheRaspberryPi/pi_minecraft/blob/main/README.md).     


## Spot Micro Robot
This was a fun project where I 3d printed the robot, planned the hardware, assembled, and used a fellow robot builder's ROS Repo to get it walking. I contributed a bit to the robot builder's ROS repo as well. Check it out [here](https://github.com/MZandtheRaspberryPi/spot_micro_demo) and a video showing off the project [here](https://youtu.be/g6FMSfrcahk).

## Pi Watch    
This was a project to make a raspberry pi watch that can check buses near my apartment, show the weather, and turn off with button presses. Check out the repo [here](https://github.com/MZandtheRaspberryPi/pi_watch) and a video showing off the project [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhEXCvS3W6M).
